Application Ideas:
* Actuallly interact with the inventory
* Move the API to Azure *** (maybe not...because sql will cost money)
* CI/CD process - Tests
* Deploy the Desktop App and allow it for "Download".
* Introduce a web-based inventory control system (maybe on Blazor)
* A Xamarim Forms app for a mobile register

5. Move the de database to Azure SQL (Maybe, cost money)
